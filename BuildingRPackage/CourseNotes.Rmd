## Developing R Packages Coursenotes
[Advanced Material for writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)

Building R packages requires a toolchain that must be in place before you begin developing. If you are developing packages that contain only R code, then the tools you need come with R and RStudio. However, if you want to build packages with compiled C or Fortran code (or which to build other people’s packages with such code), then you will need to install additional tools. Which tools you install depends on what platform you are running.

### Working with Windows
On Windows, the R Core has put together a package of tools that you can download all at once and install via a simple installer tool. The `Rtools` package comes in different versions, depending on the version of R that you are using. 

Make sure to get the version of Rtools that matches your version of R. Once you have installed this, you will have most of the tools needed to build R packages. You can optionally install a few other tools, documented [here.](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools.txt)

```{r}
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools"); library(devtools)}
if(!require(roxygen2)){install.packageS("roxygen2"); library(roxygen2)}
```

### Folder Layout to start a package

An R package begins life as a directory on your computer. This directory has a specific layout with specific files and sub-directories. The two required sub-directories are

 * R, which contains all of your R code files
 * man, which contains your documentation files.

At the top level of your package directory you will have a `DESCRIPTION` file and a `NAMESPACE` file. This represents the minimal requirements for an R package. Other files and sub-directories can be added and will discuss how and why in the sections below.

While RStudio is not required to build R packages, it contains a number of convenient features that make the development process easier and faster. That said, in order to use RStudio for package development, you must setup the environment properly. Details of how to do this can be found in Roger’s RStudio package development [pre-flight check list](https://github.com/rdpeng/daprocedures/blob/master/lists/Rpackage_preflight.md).

#### The R-Subdirectory
The R sub-directory **contains all of your R code**, either in a single file, or in multiple files. For larger packages it’s usually best to split code up into multiple files that logically group functions together. The names of the R code files do not matter, but generally it’s not a good idea to have spaces in the file names.

#### The man-Subdirectory
The man sub-directory **contains the documentation files** for all of the exported objects of a package. With older versions of R one had to write the documentation of R objects directly into the man directory using a LaTeX-style notation. 
However, with the development of the `roxygen2 package`, we no longer need to do that and can write the documentation directly into the R code files. *Therefore, you will likely have little interaction with the man directory* as all of the files in there will be auto-generated by the roxygen2 package.


R packages provide a convenient and standardized mechanism for distributing R code to a wide audience. As part of building an R package you design an interface to a collection of functions that users can access to make use of the functionality you provide. R packages are directories containing R code, documentation files, package metadata, and export/import information. Exported functions are functions that are accessible by the user; imported functions are functions in other packages that are used by your package.




### Setting up the `DESCRIPTION` file :

The DESCRIPTION file is an essential part of an R package because it contains key metadata for the package that is used by repositories like CRAN and by R itself. In particular, this file contains the package name, the version number, the author and maintainer contact information, the license information, as well as any dependencies on other packages.

As an example, here is the DESCRIPTION file for the mvtsplot package on CRAN. This package provides a function for plotting multivariate time series data.

```
Package:  mvtsplot
Version:  1.0-3
Date:  2016-05-13
Depends:  R (>= 3.0.0)
Imports: splines, graphics, grDevices, stats, RColorBrewer
Title:  Multivariate Time Series Plot
Author:  Roger D. Peng <rpeng@jhsph.edu>
Maintainer:  Roger D. Peng <rpeng@jhsph.edu>
Description:  A function for plotting multivariate time series data.
License:  GPL (>= 2)
URL: https://github.com/rdpeng/mvtsplot
```

### Setting up the `NAMESPACE` file :

The NAMESPACE file specifies the interface to the package that is presented to the user. 
This is done via a series of `export()` statements, which indicate which functions in the package are exported to the user. 

Functions that are **not exported** cannot be called directly by the user (although see below). In addition to exports, the NAMESPACE file also **specifies what functions or packages are imported** by the package. If your package depends on functions from another package, you must import them via the NAMESPACE file.

Below is the `NAMESPACE` file for the mvtsplot package described above.

```
export("mvtsplot")

import(splines)
import(RColorBrewer)
importFrom("grDevices", "colorRampPalette", "gray")
importFrom("graphics", "abline", "axis", "box", "image", "layout",
           "lines", "par", "plot", "points", "segments", "strwidth",
           "text", "Axis")
importFrom("stats", "complete.cases", "lm", "na.exclude", "predict",
           "quantile")
```

Here we can see that only a single function is exported from the package (the `mvtsplot()` function). There are two types of import statements:

 * `import()`, simply takes a package name as an argument, and the interpretation is that all exported functions from that external package will be accessible to your package
 
 * `importFrom()`, takes a package and a series of function names as arguments. This directive allows you to specify exactly which function you need from an external package. For example, this package imports the `colorRampPalette()` and `gray()` functions from the `grDevices` package.

Generally speaking, it is better to use `importFrom()` and to be specific about which function you need from an external package. However, in some cases when you truly need almost every function in a package, it may be more efficient to simply `import()` the entire package.


With **respect to exporting functions**, it is important to think through carefully which functions you want to export. 

First and foremost, *exported functions must be documented and supported*. 

Users will generally expect exported functions to be there in subsequent iterations of the package. It’s **usually best to limit the number of functions that you export** (if possible). It’s always possible to export something later if it is needed, but removing an exported function once people have gotten used to having it available can result in upset users. Finally, exporting a long list of functions has the effect of cluttering a user’s namespace with function names that may conflict with functions from other packages. 

Minimizing the number of exports **reduces the chances of a conflict with other packages** (using more package-specific function names is another way).


### Avoiding naming conflicts

As you start to use many packages in R, the likelihood of two functions having the same name increases. 

For example, the commonly used `dplyr package` has a function named `filter()`, which is also the name of a function in the stats package. If one has both packages loaded (a more than likely scenario) how can one specific exactly which `filter()` function they want to call?

In R, every function has a full name, which includes the package namespace as part of the name. This format is along the lines of

```
<package name>::<exported function name>
```


For example, the `filter()` function from the dplyr package can be referenced as `dplyr::filter()`. This way, there is no confusion over which `filter()` function we are calling. 

While in principle every function can be referenced in this way, it can be tiresome for interactive work. However, **for programming, it is often safer to reference a function using the full name** if there is even a chance that there might be confusion.

It is *possible to **call functions that are not exported** by package by using the namespace notation*. 

The `:::` operator can be used for this purpose, as in `<package name>:::<unexported function name>`. 

This can be useful for examining the code of an unexported function (e.g. for debugging purposes) or for temporarily accessing some unexported feature of a package. 

However, it’s **not a good idea to make this a habit** as such unexported functions may change or even be eliminated in future versions of the package. **Furthermore, use of the ::: operator is not allowed for packages that reside on CRAN**.


### Difference in `attaching` and `loading` a namespace

When dealing with R packages, it’s useful to understand the distinction between loading a package namespace and attaching it. 

 - When package **A imports** the namespace of package B, package A `loads` the namespace of package B in order to gain access to the exported functions of package B. 

- **However**, when the namespace of package B is loaded, it is *only available to package A*; it is **not placed on the search list**
and is not visible to the user or to other packages.

`Attaching a package namespace` places that namespace on the search list, **making it visible to the user and to other packages**. Sometimes this is needed because certain functions need to be made visible to the user and not just to a given package.


## Working with the `devtools` package by Hadley Wickham
[R Packages Workbook by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

Here are some of the key functions included in devtools and what they do, roughly in the order you are likely to use them as you develop an R package:


- load_all : 	Load the code for all functions in the package
- document : 	Create \man documentation files and the “NAMESPACE” file from roxygen2 code
- use_data : 	Save an object in your R session as a dataset in the package
- use_vignette : 	Set up the package to include a vignette
- use_readme_rmd : 	Set up the package to include a README file in Rmarkdown format
- use_build_ignore : 	Specify files that should be ignored when building the R package (for example, if you have a folder where you’re drafting a journal article about the package, you can include all related files in a folder that you set to be ignored during the package build)
check	Check the full R package for any ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs
- build_win : 	Build a version of the package for Windows and send it to be checked on a Windows machine. You’ll receive an email with a link to the results.
- use_travis : 	Set the package up to facilitate using Travis CI with the package
- use_cran_comments : 	Create a file where you can add comments to include with your CRAN submission.
- submit_cran : 	Submit the package to CRAN
- use_news_md : 	Add a file to the package to give news on changes in new versions

#### Usage:

Some of these functions you’ll only need to use once for a package. 
The `one-time (per package) functions` are mostly those that set up a certain type of infrastructure for the package. 
- For example, if you want to use R Markdown to create a README file for a package you are posting to GitHub, you can create the proper infrastructure with the `use_readme_rmd` function. This function adds a starter README file in the main directory of the package with the name “README.Rmd”. You can edit this file and render it to Markdown to provide GitHub users more information about your package. However, you will have problems with your CRAN checks if there is a README file in this top-level directory of the package, so the use_readme_rmd function also adds the files names for the R Markdown README file, and the Markdown file it creates, in the “.Rbuildignore” file, so it is not included when the package is built.

### Setting the Package Infrastructure
The earliest infrastructure function you will use from the devtools package is `create`. 

- This function **inputs the filepath** for the directory where you would like to create the package and **creates the initial package structure** (as a note, this directory should not yet exist). You will then add the elements (code, data, etc.) for the package within this structure. 
- *As an alternative to create, you can also initialize an R package in RStudio by selecting “File” -> “New Project” -> “New Direction” -> “R Package”*.

> In addition to starting a package using`create` or by creating a new project in RStudio, you could also create the package by hand, creating and then filling a directory. However, it’s hard to think of any circumstances where there would be a good reason to do that rather than using some of the more convenient tools offered by devtools and RStudio.

This Figure gives an example of what the new package directory will look like after you create an initial package structure with create or via the RStudio “New Project” interface. 

- This initial package directory includes an`R subdirectory`, where you will save R scripts with all code defining R functions for the package. - It also includes two files that will store metadata and interface information about your package (`DESCRIPTION` and `NAMESPACE`), as well as an R project file (.Rproj extension) that saves some project options for the directory. 
- Finally, the initial package structure includes two files that can be used to exclude some files in the directory from either being followed by git (.gitignore) or included when the package is built (.Rbuildignore). 

These two files have names that start with a dot, so they may not be listed if you look at the package directory structure in a file manager like “Finder” on Macs. These “dot-files” will, however, be listed in the “Files” tab that shows up in one of the RStudio panes when you open an R project like a package directory, as shown in this figure.
